Front end for the SmartBrain application. It was developed using React and the Clarifai API.

SmartBrain is a web application that lets users upload photos and will locate and identify any faces in them.

Users can register accounts and have their total number of photo uploads tracked. 
The back end repository for the SmartBrain application is named SmartBrain-BackEnd. 

SmartBrain is a project I took up to gain experience in full stack development.
